# Ethereum data set description

We describe the data set attributes below.

## Blocks data structure ([link](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/a73f3f45183a347864a1c941930d6f26c6f06ac2/graphql/schema.go#L141))

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| difficulty |  It is a measure of the difficulty of mining this block. This can be calculated from the previous block's difficulty level and the timestamp.|
| extraData | It is an arbitrary data field supplied by the miner. |
| gasLimit |  It is the maximum amount of gas that was available to transactions in this block. |
| gasUsed |  It is the amount of gas that was used executing transactions in this block. |
| hash |  It is the block hash of this block. |
| logsBloom |  It is a bloom filter that can be used to check if a block may contain log entries matching a filter. The Bloom filter is composed of indexable information (logger address and log topics) contained in each log entry from the receipt of each transaction in the transactions list. |
| miner |  It is the account that mined this block. |
| mixHash |  It is the hash that was used as an input to the PoW process. It proves combined with the nonce that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block
| nonce |  It is the block nonce, an 8-byte sequence determined by the miner. A 64-bit value which, combined with the mix-hash, proves that a sufficient amount of computation has been carried out on this block. |
| number |  It is the number of this block, starting at 0 for the genesis block. The genesis block has a number of zero. |
| parentHash |  It is the hash of the parent block's header of this block (previous block). |
| receiptsRoot |  It is the hash of the trie of transaction receipts in this block. |
| sha3Uncles |  It is a hash of all the uncles (AKA ommers) associated with this block. |
| size | The block size in bytes. |
| stateRoot |  It is the hash of the state trie after this block was processed (after all transactions are executed and finalizations applied). |
| timestamp |  It is the unix timestamp at which this block was mined. |
| totalDifficulty |  It is the sum of all difficulty values up to and including this block. |
| transactions |  It is a list of transactions associated with this block. If transactions are unavailable for this block, this field will be null. |
| transactionsRoot |  It is the keccak256 hash of the root of the trie of transactions in this block. |
| uncles |  It is a list of uncles (AKA ommer) blocks associated with this block. If uncles are unavailable, this field will be null. |

## Transactions data structure ([link](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/a73f3f45183a347864a1c941930d6f26c6f06ac2/graphql/schema.go#L73))

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| blockHash |  Block hash corresponds to the block this transaction was mined in. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
| blockNumber | Block number corresponds to the block this transaction was mined in. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
| from | From is the account that sent this transaction - this will always be an externally owned account. |
| gas | It is the maximum amount of gas this transaction can consume (AKA gasLimit). A scalar value equal to the maximum amount of gas should be used in executing this transaction. This is paid up-front before any computation is done and may not be increased later. |
| gasPrice | It is the price offered to miners for gas, in Wei per unit. A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be paid per unit of gas for all computation costs incurred as a result of the execution of this transaction. |
| hash | It is the hash of this transaction. |
| input | Input is the data supplied to the target of the transaction. |
| nonce | It is the nonce of the account this transaction was generated with. A scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent by the sender. |
| to | To is the account the transaction was sent to. This is null for contract-creating transactions. |
| transactionIndex | Index is the index (AKA position in the block) of this transaction in the parent block. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
| value | It is the value, in Wei, sent along with this transaction. A scalar value equal to the number of Wei to be transferred to the message callâ€™s recipient or, in the case of contract creation, as an endowment to the newly created account. |
| v, r, and s | Values corresponding to the signature of the transaction and used to determine the sender of the transaction. |

## Transactions Receipts data structure

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| blockHash | Block hash corresponds to the block this transaction was mined in. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
| blockNumber | Block number corresponds to the block this transaction was mined in. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
| contractAddress | It is is the account that was created by a contract creation transaction. If the transaction was not a contract creation transaction, or has not yet been mined, this field will be null. |
| cumulativeGasUsed | It is the total gas used in the block up to and including this transaction. If the transaction has not yet been mined, this field will be null. |
| from | From is the account that sent this transaction - this will always be an externally owned account. |
| gasUsed | It is the amount of gas that was used in processing this transaction. If the transaction has not yet been mined, this field will be null. |
| logs | Check data structure ?????|
| logsBloom | It is a list of log entries emitted by this transaction. If the transaction has not yet been mined, this field will be null. |
| status | Status is the return status of the transaction. This will be 1 if the transaction succeeded, or 0 if it failed (due to a rollback, or due to running out of gas). If the transaction has not yet been mined, this field will be null. |
| to | To is the account the transaction was sent to. This is null for contract-creating transactions. |
| transactionHash | It is the hash of this transaction. |
| transactionIndex | Index is the index (AKA position in the block) of this transaction in the parent block. This will be null if the transaction has not yet been mined. |
